# Scheduler 📅

## Description

As a coding boot camp student, I have created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. 
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The Scheduler 📅 will be able to:

    -- Add important events to scheduler
    -- Current date and time is shown when scheduler is loaded
    -- Work Hours are displayed for a 12 hour shift
    -- Time block are displayed and color coded for past, present, and future.
    -- When a user clicks on a time block, user is able to enter text.
    -- When user clicks on save icon, event entered is saved to local storage.
    -- When page is refreshed, saved events persists.
